## Prerequisites

- Node.js for execution
- tsc for compilation
- the fs module

## How to run

This code currently does not support interactive stdin input, so in order to run you'll have to give it an stdin input that's non-interactive such as redirection in bash (<code><</code>)

Compile and execute via makefile
```
make < testfile
```

to cleanup simply run
```
make clean
```
